							<p>Having grown up across continents, Hyo-Kyeong Ma (or Hyo for short) was destined to develop a sharp eye for global culture, an eye that informs her truly unique vision today. This young designer approaches each of her own couture creations with an innate awareness of local and international trends, seamlessly combined with the desires and tastes of each individual client.</p>

							<p>With the forthcoming launch of her own London-based brand, Ma brings a fresh and witty approach to time-honoured artisanal crafts and breathes new life into the traditions of couture. Fine workmanship meets a touch of tongue-in-cheek wit to create truly unique pieces.</p>

							<p>Ma’s career in design began in 2014, when she enrolled on the Foundation Diploma in Art and Design (Jewellery, Footwear & Fashion Accessories) at Central Saint Martins, graduating with a Distinction. Switching her focus from jewellery to textiles, she then undertook the prestigious BA(Hons) Textile Design course at Chelsea College of Arts, graduating with a First Class Honours.</p>

							<p>Enamoured by both the jewellery and textile worlds, Hyo brought elements of the two together by studying traditional embroidery techniques. Enrolling in the prestigious Royal School of Needlework at Hampton Court Palace, she dedicated her time to historical crafts, including Jacobean crewelwork, silk shading, canvas shading, stumpwork, goldwork and applique. It is these time-honoured techniques that sit at the heart of Hyo’s work today.</p>

							<p>After honing her craft alongside an award-winning Korean jewellery designer, London was calling. Here, Ma began a coveted role assisting couturiers Ralph & Russo, a house where perfection in craft reigns supreme. Whilst working as a part of the team, Ma spent thousands of hours honing her embroidery skills, collaborating on some of the design house’s most spectacular creations. She fell in love with the immense effort and acute attention to detail involved in producing breathtaking pieces.</p>

							<p>Every one of Ma’s creations is the product of a close, personal collaboration with the client. From the framework to the final stitching, every detail is entirely unique to ensure a final product that is truly one of a kind and - just like the memories they capture - no two designs will ever be the same.</p>
